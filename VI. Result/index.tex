During the project a number of different methods and practices were used to structure and guide the work within the project. These methods and practices varied in scope and area of application, ranging from initial definition of the project to structuring of the development process to finalizing development into a finished product. In order to ascertain which of these were suitable for use in small IT projects, they were all subjectively evaluated by the group. The results of this evaluation were then compiled into a table, shown here as Table \ref{tab-results}. Each method or practice was given a grade of either GOOD, MIXED or BAD and the grades color coded with green, yellow and red, respectively.

% Here you can define your own colors to use in the table.

For each method that was given a MIXED or BAD grade alternatives that could be used instead was discussed. The methods discussed were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scrum story points} - It was discussed whether or not story points had a significant enough value to the development process to be implemented. The process of assigning points to tasks was rather time consuming and determining how many points was suitable for each task was hard to get right. As an alternative the story points system could be omitted completely, essentially giving all tasks one point each so that the progress still could be tracked in the burndown chart, but the no time and effort would be spent grading tasks.
    \item \textbf{Gantt chart} - The practical use of a Gantt chart was discussed. It was established that the Gantt chart was useful in some aspects, especially in the initial face of the project were the timeline overview did help in getting a grasp of the project scope. However, the chart was perceived to be to cluttered and hard to read, with to much information crammed into one document. Because of this the Gantt chart was referred to less and less as the project work progressed. As an alternative it was suggested that the most used pieces of information got be taken from the chart and implemented in the Scrum board on a timeline instead.
    \item \textbf{Alpha States} - The feeling was that the way the alpha states were formulated made them hard to understand and therefore did not help much in analyzing progress. The time it took discussing their intended meaning did not lead to much insight in how the project was progressing and could have been spent more wisely. The alternative could be to omit this system for smaller IT projects.
    \item \textbf{Use Case Models} - The way the Use Cases were modelled was discussed. It was felt that they did not help much in explaining the use cases as they were very simplistic. It was also not clear exactly how they were meant to be constructed and because of this understanding how they should be read was also unclear. As an alternative a sliced use case chart could be used.
    \item \textbf{STM32CubeIDE} - Problems with using the manufacturer ST's IDE for programming the STM32 microprocessor was discussed. Although it had some useful functionalities it was felt that it was overly complicated and inconsistent in it's behavior across differing operating systems. Because of this, getting it to work smoothly with GitHub was problematic and time consuming. As an alternative a more scaled down 3rd party IDE, such as VSCode, could be used. This would hopefully lead to easier integration with GitHub and more stable cross platform performance.
\end{itemize}
During development, after each sprint, ways of working used during that sprint were brought up for scrutiny. This was done as a group exercise where group members were able to bring up certain ways of working that they felt needed to be focused on. It could either be to highlight something that was working well, to bring up something that needed to be changed or even stopped, or to propose something new that they felt was missing. In practice this was done by categorizing each of the things brought forward into either START, STOP or CONTINUE. The group would then address each of the added points in turn and discuss, if needed, a way to solve any issues identified with that particular point. For every new sprint the lists from the previous sprint were looked over and any points that still needed addressing were kept, and maybe re-categorized, or removed if the group felt it no longer needed addressing. In fact, even the method for this exercise was evaluated and changed between sprints, as the categories were at the first meeting defined as GOOD, COULD HAVE DONE BETTER and IMPROVEMENTS, but after the first two sprints it was decided to change them to START, STOP and CONTINUE because it was felt that this was a more concise way of naming them. The results of these exercises are presented here in Tables \ref{tab-wow1}, \ref{tab-wow2}, \ref{tab-wow3} and \ref{tab-wow4}.
